cands -> probeset random ids
cube  -> probeset cube
g_m_means -> candidate initial model
random select probeset ids
log transform get g_m_means
for each g_m_means
    model fitting
    model angle sort
    model scroing
get best model
model component mapping
if model is 3 components 
    generate a model imputation training task
else 
    generate a model imputation collect id task task

run the model imputation related tasks

for each model have missing cluster
    model inference
