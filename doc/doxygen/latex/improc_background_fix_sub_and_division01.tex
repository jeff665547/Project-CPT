Algotithm main input\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item probe grid ( grid after R\-O\-I )
\item raw image ( image after R\-O\-I )
\item marker information, include height, width, x and y direction interval
\item the local segment number in x and y direction, which denote as sxn, syn.
\item local background percentage, which denote as p
\end{DoxyItemize}

Algorithm workflow\-:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Use marker information to filter the marker probe on probe grid.
\item Split the raw image and probe grid into sxn $\ast$ syn segment. For example, let sxn=4, syn=4 and probe gird width=16, height=20, then the probe grid will be segment into 16 pieces and every pieces has width=4 and height=5.
\item For each grid segment, select the lowest p percentage probes' intensities in probe grid, and compute the mean of these probe intensities, the result is the local background.
\item For each pixel v of related segment in raw image, fix the pixel v by\-: $ v = (v - local background) / local background $
\item The local background will then used by global background process.
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Compute the mean of all locol backgrounds, which represent the global mean.
\item For each pixel v, multiply the global mean and the result is the final background fixed image of this algorithm.
