Algotithm main input\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item raw image
\item image grid tiles
\item new tile width and height after margin
\end{DoxyItemize}

Algorithm workflow\-:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item For each tiles, scan the pixels in tile by sliding windows with new tile width and height and compute the C\-V for every windows.
\item Select the window which has minimun C\-V to be the new tile.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Note that, $ CV = stddev / mean $
